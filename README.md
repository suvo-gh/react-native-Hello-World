This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## The Project is a hello world app with theme according to preset Light or Dark mode in device

# Getting Started

>**Note**: 
[React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

## Start the Server

```bash
# using npm
npm react-native run-android
```
# Personal Notes
1. Run app on android : npm react-navtive run-android
2. Safe area view -> Good coding
3. View -> similar to divs in js
4. Text -> used for text blocks

```
const app = () => {} does not work like in react
```
